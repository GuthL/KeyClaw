# CLAUDE.md — Agent Guide to KeyClaw

This file helps AI coding agents (Claude, Codex, Cursor, etc.) understand and work with the KeyClaw codebase effectively.

## What Is KeyClaw?

KeyClaw is a **local MITM proxy** written in Rust that sits between AI coding CLI tools and their APIs. It intercepts HTTP/HTTPS/WebSocket traffic, detects secrets in request payloads, replaces them with safe placeholders, and reinjects the real values in responses — all transparently.

## Build & Test

```bash
cargo build --release      # Build optimized binary
cargo test                 # Run all tests
cargo build                # Debug build (faster compilation)
```

The binary is at `./target/release/keyclaw`. No external services needed for building or testing.

## Architecture Overview

### Request Flow (outbound)

```
User CLI → KeyClaw Proxy → detect secrets (gitleaks rules) → replace with {{KEYCLAW_SECRET_xxx}}
→ store mapping in encrypted vault → forward sanitized request to API
```

### Response Flow (inbound)

```
API response → KeyClaw Proxy → scan for {{KEYCLAW_SECRET_xxx}} placeholders
→ resolve from vault → reinject real secrets → forward to CLI
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **hudsucker** is the MITM proxy engine (HTTP/HTTPS/WebSocket)
2. **Gitleaks rules are compiled natively** — 220+ rules from `gitleaks.toml` parsed at startup into Rust regex. No subprocess needed.
3. **Placeholders are deterministic** — same secret always produces same placeholder ID (5-char prefix + SHA-256 hash)
4. **Vault is AES-GCM encrypted** with scrypt key derivation, atomic writes via temp file + rename
5. **WebSocket compression is stripped** — `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` header is removed because tungstenite can't handle permessage-deflate (RSV1 bits)
6. **SSE streams are not buffered** — placeholders are resolved per-chunk via `map_frame` to preserve streaming behavior
7. **CA certs are generated at runtime** — no embedded certs, each machine generates its own on first run
8. **Custom rules** can be loaded from a file via `KEYCLAW_GITLEAKS_CONFIG` env var

## Module Map

| Module | Purpose | Key Types |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| `gitleaks_rules.rs` | Parse gitleaks.toml, compile regex rules natively | `RuleSet`, `Rule`, `SecretMatch` |
| `proxy.rs` | MITM proxy server, HTTP/WS handlers | `Server`, `KeyclawHttpHandler` |
| `pipeline.rs` | Orchestrates rewrite pipeline | `Processor`, `RewriteResult` |
| `placeholder.rs` | Secret replacement using RuleSet, placeholder generation | `replace_secrets()`, `resolve_placeholders()` |
| `redaction.rs` | JSON tree walker, notice injection | `walk_json_strings()`, `inject_redaction_notice()` |
| `vault.rs` | AES-GCM encrypted secret↔placeholder storage | `Store` |
| `certgen.rs` | Runtime CA cert/key generation via rcgen | `ensure_ca()`, `CaPair` |
| `launcher.rs` | CLI subcommands (proxy, mitm, doctor, rewrite-json) | `Runner`, `run_cli()` |
| `config.rs` | Environment variable configuration | `Config` |
| `errors.rs` | Error types with deterministic codes | `KeyclawError` |
| `logscrub.rs` | Sanitizes secrets from log output | `scrub()` |

## Common Tasks

### Adding a new secret pattern

Add a `[[rules]]` entry to `gitleaks.toml` at the repo root. The rule needs `id`, `regex`, and optionally `keywords` (for fast pre-filtering) and `secretGroup` (capture group index). Rules are compiled at startup via `include_str!`.

For custom per-deployment rules, set `KEYCLAW_GITLEAKS_CONFIG=/path/to/custom.toml`.

### Changing proxy behavior

Edit `src/proxy.rs`. The `HttpHandler` impl on `KeyclawHttpHandler` has:
- `handle_request` — intercepts outbound requests, redacts secrets
- `handle_response` — intercepts inbound responses, resolves placeholders (both streaming and non-streaming)
- `should_intercept` — decides which CONNECT tunnels to MITM

The `WebSocketHandler` impl handles WS message interception (client→server redaction, server→client resolution).

### Adding a new CLI subcommand

Edit `src/launcher.rs` → `run_cli()` match block. Add a new arm and corresponding function.

### Changing the redaction notice

Edit `src/redaction.rs` → `inject_redaction_notice()`. The notice is injected differently for Anthropic (appended to `system` field) vs OpenAI (added as `developer` role message).

## Important Patterns

### Placeholder format
```
{{KEYCLAW_SECRET_<prefix>_<16 hex chars>}}
```
Example: `{{KEYCLAW_SECRET_ghp_A_edc439282b0de94f}}`

The prefix is the first 5 characters of the secret (for human readability in logs).

### Vault path
```
~/.keyclaw/vault.enc
```

### CA cert/key (auto-generated)
```
~/.keyclaw/ca.crt
~/.keyclaw/ca.key
```

### Proxy env integration
```bash
source ~/.keyclaw/env.sh   # Sets HTTP_PROXY, SSL_CERT_FILE, etc.
```

## Error Handling

All errors use `KeyclawError` with optional deterministic codes:
- `mitm_not_effective` — proxy bypass detected
- `body_too_large` — request exceeds max body size
- `invalid_json` — JSON parse/rewrite failed
- `strict_resolve_failed` — placeholder resolution failed in strict mode

Check errors with `code_of(&err)` to get the code string.

## Testing

Tests are in `tests/`. Integration tests in `tests/integration_proxy.rs` spin up a real proxy. E2E tests in `tests/e2e_cli.rs` test the full binary. Unit tests cover placeholder logic, pipeline, and vault operations.

```bash
cargo test                          # All tests
cargo test placeholder              # Just placeholder tests
cargo test --test integration_proxy # Just proxy integration tests
cargo test --test e2e_cli           # Just e2e CLI tests
```

## Dependencies to Know

- **hudsucker 0.24** — MITM proxy engine (wraps hyper + rustls + tungstenite)
- **rcgen 0.14** — CA certificate generation (via hudsucker re-export)
- **aes-gcm** — Vault encryption
- **toml** — Parsing gitleaks.toml rules
- **regex** — Native regex compilation of gitleaks rules (with 50MB size limit for complex patterns)
- **scrypt** — Key derivation for vault passphrase

## Development Workflow

For any non-trivial change, follow this 3-phase loop:

### Phase 1: PM (spec before code)
Before writing any code, define:
- **What** — one sentence describing the change
- **Acceptance criteria** — concrete conditions that mean "done"
- **Scope** — what's in, what's explicitly out
- **Edge cases** — failure modes to handle

### Phase 2: Implement
Write the code. Run `cargo test && cargo build --release` before moving on.

### Phase 3: PR Review (self-review before commit)
Review your own changes as a critical Staff Engineer would:
- **Correctness** — does it meet the acceptance criteria?
- **Security** — any secret leaks, placeholder integrity issues, vault concerns?
- **Performance** — regex efficiency, per-request overhead?
- **Rust idioms** — proper error handling, no unwrap in production paths, lifetime correctness?

Only commit after all three phases pass.

### Ralph Loop

For iterative development with `/ralph-loop`:

```
/ralph-loop "Implement [feature].
Phase 1: Write a 5-line spec with acceptance criteria.
Phase 2: Implement. Run cargo test && cargo build --release.
Phase 3: Self-review for correctness, security, performance.
If review finds issues, fix and re-review.
When all green, commit and output <promise>DONE</promise>" --completion-promise "DONE" --max-iterations 10
```
